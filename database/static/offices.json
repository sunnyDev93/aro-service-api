Certified applicators and technicians&nbsp;must pass a written examination in order to receive their licenses.<br><br>Pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and TDA before they may&nbsp;be used in Texas. EPA registration is not a finding of product safety. Pesticides are designed to kill or control pests.<br>Your risk of harm depends upon the degree of your exposure and your individual susceptibility.&nbsp;<br><br>Specific health and safety information varies between pesticides and types of exposures and is available on the label&nbsp;information or SDS sheet, which can be supplied to you upon request from the licensed applicator. Take precautions&nbsp;when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable individuals. Pesticides may be harmful if&nbsp;swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and any unnecessary contact with&nbsp;treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to the pesticide label. The law requires that the&nbsp;application procedures specified on the label be followed.<br><br>If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you suspect a&nbsp;violation of the law regarding structural pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health emergency, seek immediate&nbsp;medical&nbsp;attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an area of common&nbsp;access at least 48 hours prior to treatment. The information sign will allow you to contact someone who can tell you what&nbsp;pesticide is being used.<br><br>If you are contracting for pest control services due to a home solicitation, you have the right to cancel the contract within&nbsp;72 hours. You may exercise this right by notifying the pest control company that you do not wish to receive their service.<br><br>For general information on pesticides, contact the National Pesticide Information Center 1-800-858-7378<br><br>For information concerning structural pest control laws, contact the Structural Pest Control Service at: 866-918-4481.<br><br>For information concerning the formulation and registration of pesticides, contact the TDA pesticide registration at (512)&nbsp;463-7407 or 800-835-5832.<br>For non-emergency health information relating to pesticides, contact Texas Department of State Health Services (512)&nbsp;458-7111.<br><br>REQUIRED BY THE TDA STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL SERVICE<br><\/p>"

Box 12847, Austin, TX 78711-2847. TDA licenses the businesses, certified applicators&nbsp;technicians, and registers apprentices who perform structural pest control work. Certified applicators and technicians&nbsp;must pass a written examination in order to receive their licenses.<br><br>Pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and TDA before they may&nbsp;be used in Texas. EPA registration is not a finding of product safety. Pesticides are designed to kill or control pests.&nbsp;Your risk of harm depends upon the degree of your exposure and your individual susceptibility.&nbsp;<br><br>Specific health and safety information varies between pesticides and types of exposures and is available on the label&nbsp;information or SDS sheet, which can be supplied to you upon request from the licensed applicator. Take precautions&nbsp;when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable individuals. Pesticides may be harmful if&nbsp;swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and any unnecessary contact with&nbsp;treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to the pesticide label. The law requires that the&nbsp;application procedures specified on the label be followed.<br><br>If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you suspect a&nbsp;violation of the law regarding structural pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health emergency, seek&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;medical&nbsp;attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an area of common&nbsp;access at least 48 hours prior to treatment. The information sign will allow you to contact someone who can tell you&nbsp;what&nbsp;pesticide is being used.<br><br>If you are contracting for pest control services due to a home solicitation, you have the right to cancel the contract within&nbsp;72 hours. You may exercise this right by notifying the pest control company that you do not wish to receive their service.<br><br>For general information on pesticides, contact the National Pesticide Information Center 1-800-858-7378<br><br>For information concerning structural pest control laws, contact the Structural Pest Control Service at: 866-918-4481.<br><br>For information concerning the formulation and registration of pesticides, contact the TDA pesticide registration at (512)&nbsp;463-7407 or 800-835-5832.<br><br>For non-emergency health information relating to pesticides, contact Texas Department of State Health Services (512)&nbsp;458-7111.<br><br>REQUIRED BY THE TDA STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL SERVICE<\/p>"

Take precautions&nbsp;when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable individuals. Pesticides may be harmful if&nbsp;swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and any unnecessary contact with&nbsp;treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to the pesticide label. The law requires that the&nbsp;application procedures specified on the label be followed.<br><br>If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you suspect a&nbsp;violation of the law regarding structural pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health emergency, seek immediate&nbsp;medical&nbsp;attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an area of common&nbsp;access at least 48 hours prior to treatment.

Certified applicators and technicians&nbsp;must pass a written examination in order to receive their licenses.<br><br>Pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and TDA before they may&nbsp;be used in Texas. EPA registration is not a finding of product safety. Pesticides are designed to kill or control pests.<br>Your risk of harm depends upon the degree of your exposure and your individual susceptibility.&nbsp;<br><br>Specific health and safety information varies between pesticides and types of exposures and is available on the label&nbsp;information or SDS sheet, which can be supplied to you upon request from the licensed applicator. Take precautions&nbsp;when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable individuals. Pesticides may be harmful if&nbsp;swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and any unnecessary contact with&nbsp;treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to the pesticide label. The law requires that the&nbsp;application procedures specified on the label be followed.<br><br>If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you suspect a&nbsp;violation of the law regarding structural pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health emergency, seek immediate&nbsp;medical&nbsp;attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an area of common&nbsp;access at least 48 hours prior to treatment. The information sign will allow you to contact someone who can tell you what&nbsp;pesticide is being used.<br><br>If you are contracting for pest control services due to a home solicitation, you have the right to cancel the contract within&nbsp;72 hours.
